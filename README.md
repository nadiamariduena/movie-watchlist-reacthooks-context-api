#### Now that we have the products showing on the screen when we type something

[<img src="./src/img/cards-grid.gif"/>]()

<br>

```javascript
<H4>{movie.release_date ? movie.release_date.substring(0, 4) : "-"}</H4>
```

<br>
 
 #### Let's implement the watchList page and button, for this we are going to use the Context API so that we can reach this from everywhere in the project.
