### Create a Movie Watchlist with React Hooks, Context API and localStorage

> In this tutorial we'll be creating a movie watchlist using React, implementing **React Hooks**, **Context API**, **storing data in localStorage** and **fetching data** from an external **API** (The Movie Database).

## Saving the Search ü•≠

##### Right now when we search for a movie and then we save it, we see that when we refresh it, we lose that watchlist

<br>

- So what we want to do now is that every time we refresh the page, we want our **watchlist** to stay where it is.

<br>

- Go to the context inside the **GlobalState.js** , there use the **useEffect**

<br>

## useEffect

> The useEffect is triggered whenever the **state** is changed inside our provider, so whenever a movie is added to our watchlist, this **useEffect** function here is triggered.

<br>
<br>

## LocalStorage

#### Whenever this useEffect is triggered, we want to save this watchlist to our localStorage

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem("watchlist");
});
//
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è local storage has to be a string, so what we are going to do is to convert this array json array to a string.
